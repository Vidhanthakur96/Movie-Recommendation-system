# Movie-Recommendation-system
We have a movie dataset from IMDB which has details of around 1000 movies across various Genres. With this dataset a movie recommendation system is built for which cosine similarity is used as we are using text data from various columns like Actor, Director and Genre. So we create a new column in the dataframe merging the mentioned columns then using TFIDF we vectorize it and create a cosine simialarity model for recommending the movie.
